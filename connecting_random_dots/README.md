# Connecting Random Dots
dots move in the screen, and the mouse (cursor) connects with nearby dots with straight lines.

## Rules
1- Dots move randomly in the screen

2- All dots are connected with each other

3- Dots that are close to the cursor, connect with him with more clear lines

4- Dots fade when they get too far away from each other

interesting:
Make dots show some kind of identification. like a number or ID
this would make it easier to study the movements of dots
